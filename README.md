# MyTube App

This is a personal project of mine to see how much of the youtube interface I can build out on my own with sparing use of tutorials as needed.

## Contribution

If you found a problem or want to submit an improvement to the project, use the Github Issues tab to create an Issue with a description of what you think needs to be changed/added. If you'd like to submit a PR with an update/fix, reference the issue number you created. Also please make sure to squash all your commits into one when you make your PR into the repository.

### Github Branching Strategy

- `main` - main branch, this is what will be deployed to DigitalOcean/whatever service it runs on
- `develop` - this is the "working branch" that is being used to develop while keeping production releases clean
